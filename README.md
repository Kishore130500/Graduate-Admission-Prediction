# Graduate Admission Prediction

With the increase in number of graduates wishing to pursue higher education, it 
becomes difficult to pursue masters based on oneâ€™s interest or academic 
performance. The project intends to evaluate four different machine learning models to find which model works best in predicting the admission chance.

## Models used
The Machine Learning Models used:
- ### Multiple linear regression (MLR)
- ### Random Forest Regression (RFR)
- ### MLR with PCA
- ### RFR with PCA

## Conclusion

MLR with PCA got highest value for r2 score and the mse ad rmse values are more closer to zero for it. The model predicts with an accuracy of 89%. Thus we recommend usin MLR with PCA among these four models for graduate admission prediction.
